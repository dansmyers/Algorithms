# CMS 460 Spring 2020: COVID-19 Response Plan

## This is still a draft. I'll send a message to the class when the final version is ready.

## Contents

This document describes the changes we'll be making to the class in response to our shift to virtual instruction for the second half of
Spring 2020.

Please read this carefully and let me know if you have questions. It covers:

- Tools we're going to use.
- Updates to our schedule and assignments.
- My plans for delivering content to you.
- How office hours will work.

**Please remember that I'm always available to help you and answer your questions**. The format of our course has changed, but I'm 
still your professor and I'm still committed to helping each of you succeed.

You should always feel free to get in touch with me by e-mail, by Slack (discussed below), or in WebEx. If you need to set up a time
to meet live via WebEx, I'm happy to accomodate that.

## Collaboration

Previously, I'd encouraged you to talk with your classmates about the course work, but to develop all of your submissions indpendently.
Under our new situation, **I don't want you to feel isolated**, so I'm now **encouraging you to collaborate freely** to complete the
course work. To start, I'll group you into teams roughly based on the people that you've been working with in class so far. Think of your team as your remote study group. 

Note that we're not doing "group projects": **please continue to submit your work individually** so I have a record of everything that's 
turned in. You can, if you like, think of this as an environment where we're still completing indvidual assignments, but you're allowed 
to freely discuss and check your work with your fellow students.

I'll start by sending each team an invite to a dedicated Slack group. We'll stay with the initial teams for a couple of weeks: if you 
want rearrange to work with other people or if you'd prefer to work independently after that point then you can feel free to make 
changes.

## Tools

### Slack

Slack is an instant messaging app that's now widely used as a replacement for e-mail in many companies. I've created a Slack
channel for our class, `#cms-460-spring-2020`.

Use the invite link posted to Canvas to join the channel. Once you've joined, post a quick intro message and a meme to let me know you've made it.

Slack will be for general discussions, questions about course logistics, check-ins, posting memes and links, etc. It's intended to be a 
way for us to stay engaged with each other and to provide opportunities for casual question and answer sessions and collaboration.

**I won't distribute course content through Slack**.

### GitHub

We'll continue to use this GitHub site, `dansmyers/Algorithms`, to keep distributing class content, handouts, and examples.

### Canvas

We'll keep using Canvas for grades, official course e-mails, and posting course-specific links that I don't want to put on the public 
GitHub.

### WebEx

I'll use WebEx for online office hours, discussed in more detail below.

**I do not plan to lecture synchronously over WebEx**. I know that our initial guidance from the Provost emphasized delivering classes synchronously, but I don't think that format is well-suited for our course. Instead, we will deliver most of the basic course content
asynchronously, using videos and readings, and use video conferencing for check-ins and office hours.

## Updated Course Schedule

### Remaining Topics

We have three sprints to get through for the rest of the semester:

- Finish sprint 5
- Sprint 6 on graph algorithms
- Sprint 7 on NP completeness

**We'll continue with the same schedule from the original sylabus unless it turns out that we need to modify it**.

### Sprint 5

Keep working on Sprint 5 with your teammates. To simplify things

### Final Exam

We will not have a written final. Giving a written exam remotely is tough, and at this point I want to prioritize writing as
much code as possible.

### Challenge Projects

I've posted the first challenge project on GitHub. There will be one more, plus a more in-depth reflective writing assignment before
the end of the semester.

## Content Delivery and Office Hours

### Course Content

You'll continue to get GitHub repos assigned through GitHub Classroom that contain the instructions and projects for each unit. I'll
also post a set of videos and other resources onto Canvas.

### Office Hours

I'll use our scheduled class times (5:20 on Monday and Wednesday) for interactive office hours via WebEx. Before each office hour period, I'll post a link to a Google doc that you can use to ask questions that you want to have answered, then use the office hour time to work through each request. I am working on a plan for recording and uploading the WebEx sessions so that you can review them even if you aren't able to join live.


## Suggestions

This is a tough time for all of us. Ultimately, what happens in this class is not the most important thing in the world right now. Our
goal is to get through the rest of the semester with the best experience possible, while managing all of the other craziness that's
happening around us.

Please stay in touch with the class. As Associate Dean Russell told some students in an earlier message, "Now is not the time to turtle."

*Do not want*.

Keep a healthy schedule and block out some time to work on each of your classes. I recognize that many of you, like my wife and I,
are dealing with additional family responsibilities now that most K-12 schools are closed. **Let me know as soon as possible if there's 
a major issue that's making it hard for you to access the class material or work on the assignments**. We'll try to proceed with as
much flexibility as possible.

We're going to get through this.
