## Contents

This document describes the changes we'll be making to the class in response to our shift to virtual instruction for the second half of
Spring 2020.

Please read this carefully and let me know if you have questions. It covers:

- Tools we're going to use.
- Updates to our schedule and assignments.
- My plans for delivering content to you.
- How office hours will work.

**Please remember that I'm always available to help you and answer your questions**. The format of our course has changed, but I'm 
still your professor and I'm still committed to helping each of you succeed.

You should always feel free to get in touch with me by e-mail, by Slack (discussed below), or in WebEx. If you need to set up a time
to meet live via WebEx, I'm happy to accomodate that.

## Collaboration

Keep working with your teams. I'm assuming that most teams already have communication channels that they're comfortable with, but I can create private Slack groups for each team if that would be helpful.

## Tools

### Slack

Slack is an instant messaging app that's now widely used as a replacement for e-mail in many companies. I've created a Slack
channel for our class, `#cms460-s20`.

Use the invite link posted to Canvas to join our group, then add yourself to the class channel. Once you've joined, post a quick intro message and a meme to let me know you've made it.

Slack will be for general discussions, questions about course logistics, check-ins, posting memes and links, etc. It's intended to be a 
way for us to stay engaged with each other and to provide opportunities for casual question and answer sessions and collaboration.

**I won't distribute course content through Slack**.

### GitHub

We'll continue to use this GitHub site, `dansmyers/Algorithms`, to keep distributing class content, handouts, and examples.

### Canvas

We'll keep using Canvas for grades, official course e-mails, and posting course-specific links that I don't want to put on the public 
GitHub.

### WebEx

I'll use WebEx for online office hours, discussed in more detail below.

**I do not plan to lecture synchronously over WebEx**. I know that our initial guidance from the Provost emphasized delivering classes synchronously, but I don't think that format is well-suited for our course. Instead, we will deliver most of the basic course content
asynchronously, using videos and readings, and use video conferencing for check-ins and office hours.

## Updated Course Schedule

### Remaining Topics

I've decided to cut Sprint 7, which would be extra material on NP Completeness. That's a nice topic, but not essential for practical purposes (basically: some problems are hard and don't have efficient algorithms, *as far as we know*).

That leaves us with Sprint 5 to finish, followed by Sprint 6 on graph algorithms, which have significant practical applications. My plan is to extend the end of Sprint 5 by half a week, to **April 1**. Sprint 6 will then run from April 1 to April 22. We'll use the last week to wrap things up and let you finish any remaining challenge projects.

### Sprint 5

Keep working on Sprint 5 with your teammates. To simplify things, you only need to produce the text write-ups: **you don't need to make videos**.

### Final Exam

**We will have a written final**. I'll let you use the last couple of class sessions to collaboratively design the content for the final. I'm not going attempt to introduce any crazy proctoring system for the final, so it will be open-everything and honor based.

### Challenge Projects

I've posted the first challenge project on GitHub. There will be at least one more, plus a more in-depth reflective writing assignment 
before the end of the semester.

## Content Delivery and Office Hours

### Course Content

You'll continue to get GitHub repos assigned through GitHub Classroom that contain the instructions and projects for each unit. I'll
also post a set of videos and other resources onto Canvas.

### Office Hours

I'll use our scheduled class times (5:20 on Monday and Wednesday) for interactive office hours via WebEx. Before each office hour period, I'll post a link to a Google doc that you can use to ask questions that you want to have answered, then use the office hour time to work through each request. I am working on a plan for recording and uploading the WebEx sessions so that you can review them even if you aren't able to join live.


## Suggestions

This is a tough time for all of us. Ultimately, what happens in this class is not the most important thing in the world right now. Our
goal is to get through the rest of the semester with the best experience possible, while managing all of the other craziness that's
happening around us.

Please stay in touch with the class. As Associate Dean Russell told some students in an earlier message, "Now is not the time to turtle."

*Do not want*.

Keep a healthy schedule and block out some time to work on each of your classes. I recognize that many of you, like my wife and I,
are dealing with additional family responsibilities now that most K-12 schools are closed. **Let me know as soon as possible if there's 
a major issue that's making it hard for you to access the class material or work on the assignments**. We'll try to proceed with as
much flexibility as possible.

We're going to get through this.
