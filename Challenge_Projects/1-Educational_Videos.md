# Educational Videos

## Due on or before April 24 (the Friday before classes end)

## Description

Make and publish an educational video about an algorithms topic. This could be:
    
    - An interesting problem that illustrates a concept from the course
    
    - An algorithm from the text that we haven't covered in class
    
    - A description of an advanced data structure
    
    - Interesting historical background on a topic
    
    - Potentially other things as long as they're cool and interesting
    
If you work on this as an individual, the video should have roughly four to five minutes of solid content.

If you work with others, the length of the video should increase proportionally, so a team of four should have a video in the 16-20 minute range. This is not as hard
to get to as you might at first expect. For team-based projects, consider digging in to one of the advanced data structures (B-trees,
skip lists, splay trees) or describing an algorithms topic that we didn't cover in class.

If you were already working on a video for Sprint 5, you can continue with that as your topic if you choose.

## Creation

You can use any tool you want to make your video as long as the result is of good quality. If you have access to Canvas Studio, I'm finding
that it works reasonably well. You can use PowerPoint to record audio with your slides as a basic option.

Think about the structure of the video: we're all doing online learning now, so you have some more insight into what makes for an 
engaging virtual experience. Think about the backwards design process:

1. What are the big takeaways from the video that you want to viewer to have at the end?

2. What experiences can you design that will reinforce those major points?

3. What necessary content and presentation details support those key experiences?

## Submission and Grading

Upload your video to YouTube using a private link, then post the link to the assignment I'll create on Canvas. 
Completing a satisfactory video will raise your final grade by one part of a letter.
